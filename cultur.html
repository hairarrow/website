      <h2>Approach</h2>
      <p class="clarification">
        General guidelines that govern design decisions
      </p>
      <p class="detail">
        Gather data from user interactions in the application to provide
        curated results. Design an approachable design aesthetic that generally
        stays out of the users way and highlights the content they want to see.
      </p>
      <p>
        We subscribe to a clear design process for every component we want to
        create. This requires flexibility and abstract thought in regards to
        the unique components that will make up our application.
      </p>
      <p>
        We establish and understand our key performance indicators to measure
        the success of a feature and the service as a whole. This will give us
        information that will help us make better design decisions.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="flow">
      <h2>User Objectives and Flow</h2>
      <p class="detail">
        The faster we learn what patterns are the most common, we can optimize
        that experience to be faster and delightful.
      </p>
      <p>
        We need to define the interactions someone could have with our service
        and create clear expectations for them. Furthermore, we need to
        understand the basic patterns a user will take to receive the content
        they want.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="process">
      <h2>Design Process</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Choose one component to work on</li>
        <li>Brain-storm ideas for that component</li>
        <li>Create sketches for those ideas; continue brain-storming</li>
        <li>
          After sketching, create a prototype of that component to test
          interactions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            After finishing a prototype, we agree to stop iterating and start
            designing the next component on the agenda. We should still be
            flexible when new ideas come up, but heavy iteration should be avoided
            until we can make design decisions that are supported by UX research.
          </p>
          <p>
            This approach can be strict, but the goal is to minimize risk, reduce
            costs, and optimize the use of our resources.

        <li>

            From wikipedia:
            The process of gathering and measuring information on targeted
            variables in an established systematic fashion, which then enables
            one to answer relevant questions and evaluate outcomes.

          <p class="tags">
            backend, almost no visual design, expensive but worth it
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Every action a user takes in the application should be tracked
              and analyzed to provide better content curation.
            </li>
            <li>
              People need to subscribe to a category. We should optimize the
              events and deals displayed to correlate with a users interests.
            </li>
            <li>
              Events and deals should be actionable. People should have the
              expectation that they can add an event to their calendars, share
              it with friends or groups of people, like an event or see similar
              events or deals, and dislike an event or deal. In the case of
              disliking an item, we should clarify the reason behind disliking
              to keep our curation engine accurate.
            </li>
            <li>
              We should know what is trending in specific categories, events and
              collections.
            </li>
            <li>
              Users should be able to follow other users, venues and artists.
              Events and deals from sources a person follows should have a
              higher importance in relation to other presentation components.
            </li>
            <li class="game">
              <h4>The Game</h4>
              <p>
                I want to create a fun game to help us curate events and deals
                for our cultur users. This component would be included in
                different parts of our application and could have active and
                passive interactions.
              </p>
              <h5>Interface Considerations: Passive</h5>
              <p>
                As a crucial component in data acquisition, the game should be
                a persistent passive presence that sends out a signals that
                reward users when acting on an event or deal.
              </p>
              <p>
                This approach aims to create incentives for users to interact
                with our services and let them know we're actively curating
                the content they see. Think about Pandora's Music Streaming
                service, a big reason for their success in retention is how it
                remembers a users musical taste to curate the content presented.
              </p>
              <h5>Interface Considerations: Active</h5>
              <p>
                We would give users an option to quickly catch up on events or
                deals that could interest them with a card-swiping game.
              </p>
              <p>
                When we consider how to display information, we usually decide
                that an item should display relevant data points about the
                content; this includes addresses, pictures, prices, categories,
                people going, and many more. We find a problem when we present
                a list of many items that is easily cluttered depending on the
                amount of data displayed.
              </p>
              <p>
                A card interface facilitates the display of more relevant data
                because a user is only shown one element that allows for focused
                interactions. Furthermore, if they play the game, they're forced
                to take some sort of action on an event which will help our
                curation efforts.
              </p>

        <li class="notifications">
          <h3>Notifications</h3>
          <p class="tags">backend, native, intelligent, MUST</p>
          <h4>Rule 1: Notifications need to be intelligent.</h4>
          <p>
            Too many notifications will be annoying and could harm the user-base;
            too few notifications will be ignored in the slurry of signals a
            user receives in a day.
          </p>
          <h4>Rule 2: Notifications should be curated</h4>
          <p>
            We should only send notifications after establishing a strong
            correlation between the item and a user's interests.
          </p>
          <h4>Rule 3: Notifications should be geo-fenced</h4>
          <p>
            After all, that's how we're going to make money on deals and
            featured events, but these will always need to pass rule 1 and 2.
          </p>
          <h4>Notifications should follow our rules and cover:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Upcoming events or deals</li>
            <li>Nearby deals</li>

          <p>
            This could use "the game" to kick everything off and familiarize

              notification options to ensure they only receive content they
              care about.
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>Location:</em>
              We will use location services to let people know when something
              interesting is happening near them, or if they could take
              advantage of a nearby deal the want.
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>Facebook:</em>
              We use Facebook to help people share items with friends and see
              what deals or events their friends have share or expressed
              interest in. We will never post to Facebook without a users
              permission.

            front-end, graphic design, back-end, machine-assisted
            editorial content
          </p>
          <p>
            Collections are curated lists of events and deals that match a
            specific theme. For example:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Reggae Concerts</li>
            <li>Outdoors Family Activities</li>
            <li>Technology meet-ups and Presentations</li>
            <li>This Weekend</li>
            <li>Most Popular for [some category]</li>
            <li>Editor's Choice</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            These collections could be presented as a list and could incorporate
            the active interface of "the game". They should be updated
            frequently and have constraints that dictate who sees them.
            Collections will be a part of a cultur, and as such, they could be
            featured at the top filtered results and will only be displayed to
            people that follow those culturs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Basically, they're collections of events and deals that belong to a
            specific cultur and have a shared theme.
